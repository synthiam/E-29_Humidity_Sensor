This sensor is used to measure Realtive Humidity (in percent) and Temperature (in degrees Celcius) with high accuracy. A unique feature of this sensor is that it takes the digital readout from the HDC1080 and converts it to analog so that it can easily be read by a variety of microcontroller boards. It also has an on-board select button, along with RGB LED mode indicator, to allow the output reading for either Humidity or Temperature to be selected.
